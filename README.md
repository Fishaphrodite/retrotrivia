# Retrotrivia 
![Retrotrivia](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lbrpdx/retrotrivia/master/assets/logo.png)

A trivia game for retrogaming lovers.

## What's the game?

You will be asked questions about your retro video games, and some general retro-gaming trivia. 
Several gaming modes ara available:
 - 100+ handcrafted trivia questions
 - video thumbnails: guess what game is shown

Rules: you have a countdown timer for each question. You need to answer before the countdown times out. Let's say you give your answer with 5 seconds left on the timer: if your answer is correct, you score 5 points, if not, you lose 5 points. Be fast, be bold: you won't go below 0 on your score.

In future releases:
 - multi-player
 - other game modes...

## Installation

This game is primarily meant to be used with [Batocera](https://batocera.org/). It's been developed and tested with Batocera 29 and its [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org) installation. You can most probably adapt it to other retrogaming distribiutions using EmulationStation `gamelist.xml` classic format.

On Batocera, get the files from this GitHub repository, and put them into `/userdata/roms/pygame/retrotrivia`.

Controls:
 - D-Pad to select the answer.
 - A (or B) button to select/move to the next question.
